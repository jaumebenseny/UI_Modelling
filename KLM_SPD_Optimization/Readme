Design Optimization with Random Search
-----------------------------------------

In order to address non-trivial design decisions, inicial interface design is extended to explore a larger space by random search. Variables defining the basic interface design (based on customer's requirements and available in Benseny_sketches.pdf document) are discretized in order to make the space of feasible size.

Discrete Variables to be optimized
• Total number of categories and their height relative to screen size
• Number of subcategories / category their width relative to screen size
• Scrolling
• Item height (zoom in / amplification?)

An evaluation function is coded to predict how each design scores against interface requirements. The following models are applied:
- KLM to estimate execution time of main user tasks (to be minimized)
- SDP to optimize layout design based on design decisions (evolve design)
